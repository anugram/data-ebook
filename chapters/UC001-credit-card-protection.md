Protecting credit card data is critical due to its sensitive nature and regulatory requirements like **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**. 
Below are some of the commonly recommended techniques, algorithms, and parameters to secure such data:

## 1. Encryption (At Rest & In Transit)
**Recommended Algorithms & Parameters:**

- **Symmetric Encryption (for storage & high-speed encryption):**
  - **AES-256** (Advanced Encryption Standard)
    - Mode: **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)** (provides authenticated encryption)
    - Key Size: **256-bit** (PCI-DSS recommends at least 128-bit, but 256 is stronger)
    - IV (Initialization Vector): **Randomly generated per encryption**

- **Asymmetric Encryption (for secure key exchange):**
  - **RSA** (3072-bit or 4096-bit keys)
  - **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** (e.g., ECDSA with secp384r1 curve)

- **TLS for Data in Transit:**
  - **Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3** (PCI-DSS mandates disabling TLS 1.0 & 1.1)
  - Cipher Suites: Prefer **AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, ECDHE for key exchange**

## 2. Tokenization (Replace Sensitive Data with Tokens)
- **Use Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) or Vault-Based Tokenization**
- Example:
  - Original: 4111 1111 1111 1111 → Token: tok_4x12a9b7e3f8c2d1
- **Benefits**: Reduces PCI-DSS scope since tokens are useless if stolen.

## 3. Masking (Display Protection)
- **Partial Masking (for displaying only last 4 digits):**
  - Example: **** **** **** 1111
- **Algorithm**: Simple string manipulation (no cryptographic strength needed).

## 4. Hashing (For Storing PANs Securely)
- **Use Strong, Irreversible Hashing:**
  - **SHA-512** with **Per-User Salt** (unique random salt per entry)
  - **PBKDF2** (if hashing needs to be slow to prevent brute force)
    - Iterations: ≥ 100,000 (PCI-DSS recommends high computational cost)
⚠️ Do not use obsolete methods such as MD5 or SHA-1 (broken for security purposes).

## 5. Key Management (Critical for Encryption)
- **HSM (Hardware Security Module)** for storing encryption keys.
- **Key Rotation Policy:**
  - **AES keys**: Rotate every **1-2 years** (or per PCI-DSS requirements).
  - **RSA keys**: Rotate every **2-3 years**.
- Use Key Derivation Functions (KDF):
  - HKDF (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function)

## 6. Access Control & Monitoring
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Only authorized personnel should access raw data.
- Audit Logs: Log all access to cardholder data (PCI-DSS Requirement 10).
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for database/API access.

## 7. Data Minimization & Retention Policies
- PCI-DSS Requirement 3.2: Do not store sensitive authentication data (CVV, full track data) after authorization.
- Automated Deletion: Delete unnecessary card data after a set period.
