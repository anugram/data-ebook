# Securing Sensitive Data with Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform: Practical Use Cases

Welcome to this open guide on leveraging ThalesGroup CipherTrust Data Security Platform (CDSP) and it's various connectors to solve common, critical data security challenges.

Modern applications frequently handle sensitive information, such as financial details, personal identification numbers, and health records. 
Mishandling this data can lead to severe consequences, including hefty compliance fines (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.), reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

This book explores real-world scenarios where traditional data handling methods fall short and demonstrates how leveraging CDSP provides robust security, simplifies compliance, and allows developers to focus on core application features.
